This is a beginner-intermediate friendly level data exploration project using the Covid 19 dataset.

This project was done using SQL and is part of a portfolio project series.

This was done using a tutorial by Alex the Analyst but a couple of changes were made to best suit what I wanted to achieve.

It is beginner friendly which will later be visualized using Tableau public.
